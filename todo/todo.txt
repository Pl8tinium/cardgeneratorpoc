2. change express input so it only takes /nft/hen/<nft-id>
parse out the nft id, take the nft id and graph ql query it against
hicdex.com to retrieve the data object that contains the display uri
2.5 translate this script into js to retrieve the profile image
https://gist.github.com/vaultec81/06c1e06fb5499485512cfde0e68a950e
tzpData['logo'] is the image
3. download those 2 images and do the card magic
4. save the card under the nft id so ex 4524.png
5. at the end the express endpoint should return the head html with the
twitter metadata, including the path to the recently created card



maybe impl.:

caching for avatars/ images
